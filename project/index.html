          <h3>General Knowledge</h3>
          <p>General knowledge has been defined in differential psychology as "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media" and encompassing a wide subject range.[1] This definition excludes highly specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium. General knowledge is an important component of crystallized intelligence and is strongly associated with general intelligence, and with openness to experience.[2]

Studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many.[1][3][4][5] General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term semantic memory ability.[3]

A number of studies have found that males tend to have greater general knowledge than females, perhaps due to gender differences in interests rather than memory ability.[1] Recent studies have found that general knowledge is associated with exam performance in schoolchildren[6] and proofreading skills.</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>
Differential psychology researchers define general knowledge as "culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media."[1] The scope of this definition includes all areas of knowledge available to laypersons without requiring extensive training. The definition excludes "ephemera", or information confined to a single medium, such as television sitcoms. Researchers have identified 20 domains of knowledge that meet the above criteria
